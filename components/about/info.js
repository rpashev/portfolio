      <p>
        As a naturally very curious person, it made sense for me to immerse
        myself in web development - a dynamic field where you can learn and
        apply new things every day. I love building things and care about
        getting better, challenging myself on a day to day basis. For me, web
        development is a journey without an end destination and I just enjoy the
        truly rewarding process of learning how to solve meaningful problems in
        novel ways.
